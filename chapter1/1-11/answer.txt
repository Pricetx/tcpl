The word count program could be tested by writing a standard test sample
which could be tested against both the word count program and UNIX wc, or
the sample word count could be totalled manually.

A sample that would likely uncover bugs in the program is one that makes
extensive use of a combination of ' ', '\n' and '\t', including chaining
several of them together in sequence.
